## 📌 Project Overview
Our team—Vivek, me , and Harikrushn—set out to build a simple yet responsive website to showcase our learning journey in HTML and CSS. This project serves as a hands-on demonstration of the core web development skills we’ve acquired and provides a practical example of how to structure and style a webpage.

We focused on creating a clean, accessible, and responsive webpage, combining HTML for content structure and CSS for styling and layout. The end result is a fully functional web page that adapts to various screen sizes and provides an engaging user experience.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
HTML: For building the structure and content of the webpage 📄.
CSS: For styling the page, making it visually appealing and responsive 🎨.
## 🛠️ Tools & Resources
Code Editor:

VS Code (with Prettier and Live Server extensions)
Browsers:

Google Chrome (for development and debugging)
Mozilla Firefox (for cross-browser testing)
Version Control:

GitHub (for managing project code and version control)
Learning Resources:

MDN Web Docs (for HTML and CSS documentation)
W3Schools (for quick references and examples)
## ✨ Key Features
Responsive Design 📱💻: The page adjusts to different screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Simple Navigation Bar 🧭: A clean and intuitive navigation bar to easily access different sections.
Color Palette 🎨: A modern and easy-on-the-eyes color scheme that enhances the visual appeal.
Hover Effects ✨: Interactive hover effects for buttons and links, providing visual feedback to users.
Content Layout 🖼️: A well-organized layout with proper spacing for readability and clarity.

  └── README.md     # Project documentation (this file)
## 🧠 Challenges & Solutions
1. Responsive Design
Challenge: Making sure the page looks good on various screen sizes was tricky.
Solution: We used CSS media queries to adjust the layout based on the device width and ensure that the page is mobile-friendly.
2. Cross-Browser Compatibility
Challenge: Styles looked different in various browsers.
Solution: We tested the page in both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, making necessary adjustments to ensure consistent styling across all browsers.
3. Learning New Concepts
Challenge: Understanding CSS Flexbox and Grid initially felt overwhelming.
Solution: We referred to online tutorials and documentation (like MDN Web Docs), and tackled it by collaborating as a team to divide the work.
⏩ Future Enhancements

Animations 🎬: Implement CSS animations to create smoother visual transitions.
SEO Optimization 📈: Improve SEO by adding meta tags and improving load times.
Accessibility Improvements ♿: Ensure the webpage is accessible to users with disabilities by adding ARIA attributes and improving keyboard navigation.
📅 Milestones
